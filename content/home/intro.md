üëã  <p style="text-align:justify">I am a final year undergraduate student pursuing  <strong>Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech)</strong> in  <strong>Electronics and Communication Engineering</strong> at the distinguished  <strong>Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics (IRPE)</strong>, <a href="https://www.caluniv.ac.in/">University of Calcutta</a>, India. 
              <p style="text-align:justify">
                I consider myself immensely fortunate to have been graced with invaluable guidance and mentorship from esteemed researchers over the years. Currently, I am working as an intern in <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong> under the supervison of <a href="https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/xu.html">Prof. Min Xu</a>, where my work revolves around the visualization and analysis of RNAscope‚Ñ¢ images.

These innovative frameworks were meticulously designed to advance the domain of object tracking.
                I have also worked extensively with <a href="https://www.caluniv.ac.in/academic/RPE/Anisha-Halder-Roy.pdf">Prof. Anisha Halder Roy</a> on various Human-Computer Interface tasks. Additionally, I have gained experience as an intern at <strong>C-DAC, Pune</strong>, working under the guidance of Dr. Anil Kumar Gupta.
